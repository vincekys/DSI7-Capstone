# Capstone Project for DSI

Created a business intelligence tool which would help hotel managers understand customers' feedback based on reviews posted in social media and booking sites.

Hoteliers would be able to garner intelligence from large unstructured data across the internet platform.

Under the hood of this business intelligence tool are unsupervised natural language processing techniques and simple database - dashboard interaction that can be easily adopted by businesses.
