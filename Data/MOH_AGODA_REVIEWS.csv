After the first experience we moved to a club lounge where the experience was better but choice was limited.  When we asked for extra's due to our dietary needs we were told that the extra's were chargeable.  We are talking of berries and avocado - nothing special. No other hotel has charged us extra for these.

However, the cons are negligible (especially if you don't intend to use the hotel gym). I would still return to this hotel. Also, if you are not big on buffets, I suggest getting a room without the breakfast option.

Stayed 1 night in June 2018,Couple,"Reviewed June 27, 2018","Cons:
Expensive room rate
Swimming pool is small and location of it is weird. Beside the lobby where all eyes were on you while they waiting for rooms to be ready. 

Pros:
Depend on occupy rate. I'm given a free upgrade to superior deluxe, early check in and late check-out over the counter.
Complimentary cake was send to room for birthday celebration.

Tips:
Request for upgrade to superior deluxe at the main tower. The gym is at 37th floor of the main tower. If you were to stay at orchard wing, need to come down to lobby and walk to the main tower and up to gym.
Prepare for late night shopping at DonDonDonki where the crowd was cut by 80%. Or go for steamboat @ HaiDiLao at 313 where there is totally no Q.  Bear in mind that at peak hour, may wait up to 3~4 hours.g

People were actually waiting to be seated for a buffet breakfast. I was not seated until 9.45am. There was still a long line behind me when I gave the reception my room number.

However, location is a mixed view for me atleast. Bear in mind that Mandarin Orchard is right smack along the middle of Orchard Rd which is convenient for walking distances. 

The only problem (or perhaps an issue) is the building orientation/ circulation.   The entry from lobby to lift to room is somewhat troubl, but only for late-nighters I suppose as you may have  enter/exit and switch lifts from different levels.  There are two different towers or blocks which shares the same taxi drop off area.

For room window views, this also applies to luck or perhaps room types to be precise. I got the back view of the building. I was hoping to get the one facing Orchard Rd. Then again why complain when expensive room types are usually the ones getting those good city views.

The one and only thing that I love from this hotel was their breakfast. You will be spoiled with choices that I recommend you come in early so you can have a leisurely breakfast!

One thing that made me very angry though, we had to go to Kallang at 6am in the morning. So there was one taxi driver who drove a silver cab, I forgot the name. We got in, greeted him good morning and say Uncle, can take us to Kallang please? He drove away from the Mandarin Orchard driveway, drives to infront of Paragon, and stops the car. He says ""Get out."" You can imagine the shock and anger I felt. I warned the driver ""I can see your name. You sure you are going to drop us at the side of the road?"" and out we went. I limped back to the hotel on my still fractured foot and yes we reported the incident.  Kudos to the Hotel Staff especially concierge and Duty manager for ensuring I was fine.

We were first assigned the refurbished rooms in the Main Wing which we loved. Spacious and very nicely appointed . Unfortunately the bathroom wasnt suitable for Dad as it only had a long bath with a very high side so had to switch to rooms on the Orchard Wing with walk in shower. 

While the rooms on the Orchard wing were smaller , the power plugs provided were better for international adapters (mine could fit without blocking the on/off rocker switch) so in the end it turned out better. We have only one comment that the stained glass window between the bathroom and the room needs to have some sort of curtain or blind so that usage of the bathroom at night by one party will not cause the other persons in the room to be woken by the light from the bathroom.",Great hotel for business or shopping in Singapore”,Hsiu from Malaysia

Nancy, our front desk receptionist started our experience delightfully. Having stayed and top hotels around the world Nancy is one of the most gracious and attentive receptionist I have had the privilege to meet. From our first contact I knew the quality of service we could expect.

We stayed in two deluxe rooms in the Orchard Tower. They were meticulously clean and nicely appointed. The bathrooms have a unique feature which is a translucent print that brings light from the bedroom in during the day and is illuminated in the evening when the bathroom lights on on.

The large flat screen television has a range of options for entertainment, dining and information after you move past the personalized welcome greeting. A nice touch is that it is volume limited which assures that adjacent rooms are not blasted with television sounds. A welcome consideration I wish other hotels would adopt.

One of my personal criteria for a great hotel is the quality of the shower and bath and both are superb here. I love a strong shower and this was one of the best anywhere I have stayed.

I chose the Mandarin Orchard primarily for its central location in the middle of Orchard Road across from Takashimaya, Ngee Ann City, Paragon and close to Somerset 313 and Somerset MRT with some of the best shopping in the world. This is a shoppers paradise but not for the faint of cash or credit!

The location is enhanced by the 4 levels of shops, restaurants and boutique grocer to peruse and choose gourmet snacks and beverages.

Stayed 3 nights in September 2013,Solo traveler,"Reviewed September 14, 2013","When I checked in I requested to be placed on the new Main Tower of the hotel. Instead they placed us in the old Orchard wing. I have heard bad reviews about this wing and I can understand why. My friends were booked in the Main tower and their rooms were excellent. In our case the rooms in Orchard Wing are ok BUT the sound proofing was TERRIBLE. During our first night we had some visitors in our room and we were only chatting when the manager called us that the other guests in the other room requested if we kept our voices down since they can hear us through the walls. I told the manager that we would continue our conversation the next day since the other guests can hear us. at around 3am I was woken up by our neighbours snoring, I could hear him from our room! because of this i had a hard time sleeping. On our second night me and my roommate were only talking when suddenly the other guests in the other room banged our wall, probably because they can hear us again. The people in the other room were really rude, I did not bother waking them up because I could hear their snoring the previous night then they didnt even have the courtesy to just knock on our door and tell us that they can hear us. Anyway I called the manager and explained all of this, and told her that this is the reason why I requested to be placed in the MAIN TOWER because the ORCHARD WING was terrible. The good side to our trip was that the manager upgraded us to the regency suite which was still in the orchard wing. The room was really Big and the sound proofing was a lot better. Overall our stay was a little rough because of everything that happened. instead of being able to relax we were annoyed by what our neighbours did and we were restricted because we cannot even talk because if we did the other guests would hear us. Anyway the hotel is generally good and the staff are really accommodating, BUT if you are going to book in this hotel DO NOT let them book you in the orchard wing.

The location was superb and check in and check out was fast. Before coming to Singapore, I requested a room at the Main Tower and got what i asked for. We were placed in what seems to be like a newly built room with all the furnitures still barely used. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was huge. 

As for the location, i would really recommend this hotel because it is in the center of Orchard road which is highly accessible to shops and restaurants. I'm sure I will book again in this hotel when I go back to Singapore.

We didn't use the eating options at the hotel as we were out every day till after dinner, after getting up late!

The reason that makes me keep coming back to Mandarin Orchard is its location.  It's best for family with young children.  One, because it is near shopping malls and eating outlets.  Two, it's got one of the best local food restaurants in town.  When my children are too tired from the day's outings, we can just dine in at Chatterbox or order room service.  It's got menu with good varieties.  And surprisingly, good taste too!  I don't find that in most hotels that I stay (and I travel a lot).  Our favourite? Hainanese chicken rice, satay, chicken wings, hor fun, laksa... and tau suan for dessert.  Now that's what I call ""real local food"".

If only they could scale down the room rates for suites (junior / executive) to a more attractive / reasonable level.  Family with children need space.

We didnt realise how popular it would be, and missed out (on the to do list for next time!). A river cruise is also good to get a different perspective of the city. If you like seafood, a taxi ride to East Coast Seafood Centre is a must (about 15 or 20 mins away) for dinner. For perfume dont buy it anywhere except Mustafa in LIttle India - its about half the price of the big shopping centres elsewhere. If you want gold jewellery, Mustafa is also the place to go, it has the hugest range of jewellery in one place i have ever seen. If you are going to Chinatown, try the peking duck at Da Dong Restaurant in Smith street (go upstairs and the owner will look after you). I could go on and on about the Mandarin Oriental, but quite simply it is an awesome place to spend your time in Singapore. Great location and service outstanding. The only gripe i have is that the internet is quite expensive - $150 for 5 days access, which i thought was a bit steep. Would i stay here again? Absolutely, its amazing.

The hotel offered comfort, impeccable service, great food, and just the right amount of security and quiet that tourists need after a long day of sight-seeing and shopping.  We were upgraded to the next level of room upon check-in (which I found so gracious of Jenny Ho, the front desk staff).  My children loved the room - big space, comfortable beds, clean smell and the bathtub!  My son enjoyed hours relaxing in a bubble bath there.  All of the staff we met were courteous, friendly, and accommodating.  Lunch at Chatterbox on day 2 was very satisfying - plus the city view from the top was breath-taking.

Stayed 2 nights in October 2017,Business traveler,"Reviewed October 31, 2017","personally i think the location is one of the best.

but hotel must hire more polite staffs, Front Office staffs were nice, i'll say best of out all.

HK were ok, the worst is FB... talked to loud and treated guests like dogs and cats.. i know there are a lot of guests and you need to explain the same thing all the time and many times a day.

but that does not give you the rights to shout and to talk very loudly like i have asked the same question for the past 10 years every day and every minutes of the day. Also what kind of greeting is this?

Lady staff : Ah hello, how people are you? and what room?
me : Room 807, i believe my dad is already here.
Lady staff : oh room 807 ahh... can can go in go in..

What the hell? seriously?

Egg station for breakfast was just too rude as well, my dad asked for sunny side up, he just ignored, no reply no acknowledgment, nothing at all. So my dad was forced to just stand there and wait, once the egg was ready he just threw the egg into my dad plate.

Plates are dirty and not properly dried before letting guests use, that is just plain disgusting. 

Also, i have made booking for twin beds NON SMOKING! Upon check-in, i was told, ""sorry sir, we dont have any twin beds non smoking, only on smoking floor. We have no more twin beds in the hotel.""

what choice to do have? said NO i can not accept and get no refund? cancelled my business meetings? Front office has to proper assign the rooms accordingly to guest bookings, if not capable to do so, i believe the hotel has to start looking for new Front Office Manager or worst Director of Room.

The only compensation i was given was Twin Beds, Smoking Room, Small electronic perfume infuse thing, and upgrade to Premier Room. 

And one more thing, Singapore is a TOTAL AGAINST smoking in public, how come where are still SMOKING FLOOR!!!!!

Honestly, not impress with the hotel.

Stayed 4 nights in September 2016,Couple,"Reviewed October 03, 2016","Booked on agoda, 874 US dollars for 4 nights.  That's close to $220 a night.  Thought I would be getting a 5 star hotel experience.  more like 4 star.  They tried to upsell me when I checked in.  I thought 220 a night was enough to pay.  No bellhop helping with my bags.  Room was small.  ""King sized"" bed was just two twin beds pushed together with a king sized sheet over it.  you could feel the uneven border between the two mattresses.   Room has a nuisance feature: a stained glass window between the bathroom and the bedroom and no curtain to cover it up.  So when you get up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom, turning on the light in the bathroom illuminates the entire bedroom as well and disturbs your partner/spouse who may still be in the bed.   Free breakfast buffet was crowded and had to wait for a table.  There are two breakfast buffet restaurants and one was definitely better than the other.  When there were no tables in the superior restaurant, staff would try to shuffle you off into the inferior restaurant.   Otherwise, the staff were very good.   

I've seen better hotel rooms for this money in the heart of major Asian cities.  Perhaps I should try booking through expedia next time, or directly through the hotel.  Seems like the Agoda block of rooms are the least favorable.  ",small room”,david from Thailand

Stayed 3 nights in September 2016,Business traveler,"Reviewed September 26, 2016","I have stayed at the Mandarin Orchard quite a few times following the renovation some years back. There are two different wings and the rooms are fairly large by today's standards. The carpet is looking a little tired now in the room, and the hallways are quite dark, but other than that, the room is very good. The property is now offering a free hand phone in every room with free international and local calls as well as surfing. A very nice feature and something I have not seen before in a hotel.

The service at the Mandarin Orchard is excellent. Even the older employees in the restaurant are mostly sweet and supportive and cannot do enough for you.

The location is very central and you can easily walk to a variety of shopping locations as they are only a few steps a way.

The ""pad for"" breakfast is good, but it is not great. The scrambled eggs are runny, and most importantly, cold. The Chinese fried rice is also cold, Dum Sum options are very local, and bread selection is a disappointment. Sorry to say, you will find a better breakfast in most five star hotels in Jakarta. Despite the cold food, it is ample and you will not leave hungry. 

I did try the Japanese and Seafood buffet one evening and I must say that it was excellent. They offer a wide array of chilled seafood - most notably Alaskan Snow Crab which is not easy to find in SE Asia! Very pricey at S$ 88, but if you are a guest in the hotel, they offer a 20% discount. Though it is expensive, it is worth the splurge if your in the mood for chilled seafood and Japanese food.

The lcation is great for those wanting to experience Orchard Road and the MRT is very close by if wanting to explore more of the city.

The wifi was great, good speed and stable though required to re log in now and again. We chose not to dine here but in a few of the many restaurants very close by. 
 Our only dissatisfaction came at check in and check out... on check in we were informed that as we had booked ( and fully paid for) via agoda, we were required to provide a $ 200 cash or credit card deposit. Having booked many hotels via agoda for the last 5 years this was something I hadnt come across since travelling China years ago. Anyway, deposit paid and holiday went well until check out where due to our own fault the receipt for the deposit was mislaid, and due to "" hotel policy "" they were unable to provide us with our deposit. Ca- ching...I am sure I could hear the old cash register bells ringing up an extra profit for the day. Well, Singapore $$ dont come terribly cheap so this involved standing our ground with the reception staff and management for the return of our deposit.

Went to ZoukOut Event and have difficulty getting metered taxi back to Hotel. Later found out from taxi drivers that some bell boys directing taxi for hotel shouted at some of them after dropping off customers at hotel entrance.
You can see that bell boys have to walk out to road to get taxi for the hotel and some taxi just drove by ignoring them. This is true and told by another taxi driver.

Made a complaint at the level 5 lobby about this but they say ""It is not the hotel's problem, it is the taxi company. And THERE IS NOTHING WE CAN DO"" instead of looking into the matter.

I would not recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay around Orchard Road because:
Difficult to get taxis back after big events or peak hours.
Staff cannot do anything to improve the hotels reputation which makes this not a 5 star hotel.

not really liking the entrance where we as the guest get together with the other crowds, need to go to level 5 for reception.. while at lobby, I must get together with the rest of the crowds to get cabs... and it is a raining season, so the tendency to get a cab is higher, and the concierge down there asked me to queue up like others who is non hotel guests
I was asking where can I get a cab, and he just straight away pointing on public queue for cab... while when I checked out, they saw my luggage and just come to ask for any cabs for me...
Would it be more nicer if someone ask about where to get a cab, and asked nicely, are you stay inhouse?... despite of making the guest inhouse to look for my own cab...

We tried the breakfast once on the ground floor and found it was also rather bland, it was also a very noisy environment, so we just stuck to having breakfast on the club room.

Stayed 3 nights in November 2014,Solo traveler,"Reviewed November 30, 2014","I have a mixed experience staying in Mandarin Orchard. The room was great and the service was excellent. I got my room upgraded to premier room from the standard room that I booked. And  I even got a surprise Birthday Cake in my room on my birthday, which is on the 2nd day of my stay.
However,  I need to point out that there were some loophole that can be improved. 
On the 2nd night of my staying,  my neighbour room which has a connecting door to my room was enjoying their TV loudly and the sound traveled into my room easily,  giving a hard time for me to sleep. This was last until aroubd 3am, when I finally decide to pick up the phone and call the guest service to request for some help. Within 10minutes time I heard the phone rang next door and then the loud TV sound were off. 
I must thanked the Guest Service who helped to settle this thing, but would advise that the sound insulation for connectiny rooms to be greatly enhanced, perhaps by ensuring that the sound will not travel from one room to another in any possible ways.
One other little thing that I would like to highlight were the facts that most shops in Mandarin Gallery have no ideas of the MOS Guest Privilege to shop at their shops. Even when I highlighted the information given from the MOS website about the MG privilege for the MOS guests, they said that no such promotion is valid at their outlets and that they have no such agreements with the hotel. 

Other than these 2 unpleasant little events,  I must admit that I enjoyed stay in MOS, and hoping that next time I'm in town and staying at MOS, these events will not repeated themselves, and the overall experience would be enhanced into a greater and more pleasant experience that I would gladly shared with my friends and family as a reference for them when visiting Singapore.",Great stay at the heart of Orchard”,Lemmuel from Indonesia

We went to Singapore on a romantic getaway so I booked a five star hotel in Mandarin Orchard.  I requested a double bed when I booked.  On check-in, I was told there are no double beds available, only twin beds.  I was thinking, ""are you freaking kidding me?""  I paid for a five star hotel and was only offered twin beds for a romantic getaway.  After some wrangling, I was finally given a double bed.  I was told that I was upgraded to the ""Club level"" so that I can get a double bed.  Apparently, non club level patrons only get twin beds.  The club level obviously get certain amenities, so after checking in, I asked if I can go the the club lounge to get a cup of coffee.  I was denied and told that I can't get any of the club amenities.  I find this policy to be truly tasteless and classless, very unbecoming of a top-notch hotel.  Can you imagine if you get upgraded from economy to business class on an airline but don't get the business class meals?  Overall, the room was nice, front desk was a little to snotty and arrogant for my taste, location was fantastic, cleanliness was adequate, but the tub was dirty.  We had to ask the housekeeper to clean the tub.  Again, five star hotel, I know it is expecting a lot but I do expect the tub to be clean.

The staff is extremely attentive, yet unobtrusive.  They are helpful while not being imposing.  The famous Chatterbox Restaurant serves up some of the best delicacies in air conditioned comfort (yes, there are street stalls that are arguably better and cheaper, but I didn't travel all this way to constantly perspire and worry about my deodorant).

It is basically what you would expect from a five star hotel in the middle of a major shopping street. Staffs are very attentive and helpful. Even though the hotel's layout is a bit confusing, staffs are always around to help. Other than English, I heard some staffs speaking in Mandarin, Bahasa Indonesia, Malay, and Japanese. 

I do have three minor complaints. First, the air conditioner in my room was extremely cold, almost to the point of freezing. Temperature control did not work as 27 degrees Celcius felt the same as 22. I had to turn the air con off every morning, return everything to room temperature, and switch it back on right before bed, so I wouldn't feel hot at night. I am sure the hotel staffs would fix it right away if I did make a complaint, however I chose not to as the solution of turning it off and on worked just fine for me. Having said that, I would expect a major hotel to have everything double checked before any guest enters.

The other complaint I have is regarding check in. The bulking number of guests staying in this hotel was served by only two or three check in counters (can't really remember, but no more than this) when I arrived. Though it did not take hours (only about 15 min of waiting time), it was honestly quiet a queue for a five star hotel.

I love staying in Mandarin when i visited Singapore. I don't know, feels Mandarin with its Asian Design and Culture creates Singaporean ambience to me. Its well located in shopping heaven Orchard Area makes an added value for this hotel. My suggestion for Mandarin is please put more seats or sofa on the reception area in first and fifth floor. Also the television have a problem, every 10 second the show will stop 10scond, and then start over and over again. it also happens in other rooms.

I went to the hotel for checked-in around 4 p.m. but I got the keys for only one room and They were told to come back for the other room with unspecified length of time. At 5.30 p.m. we went to ask at the lobby if the other room is ready. The staff said the second room still was not ready and could not tell when it will be ready. It depended on housekeeping they said. I'm very dissatisfied for this.... and There is no place to sit at the lobby for guests to wait, only 2 sofas for 6 people in the lobby.  We had to go out and came back around 7 p.m., the room was then ready.

We got the room on the Main tower, The room was not clean enough especially the carpet in the room look so dirty. Our kid lost a toy under the bed so we had to look under the bed for the toy.  Oh my!! The carpet under the bed has probably never been cleaned!  Extremely dirty there.

As such, we were prepared to deal with so many visitors that what is normally expected. I pre-paid for an Executive Premier Room but was initially given a lower room category. The receptionist didn't even bother to inform us that she gave us the lower room category. Good thing I double checked if we were given the right room category. We had to wait for another 2.5 hours since the executive premier room was not yet ready at 2pm. But I need to commend that their check-out was fast. They even have option for an express check-out that you can do through the TV inside the room. 
2. The room & bathroom are immaculately clean. Bed, pillows, and linens are so comfortable and clean as well. Bathroom had a separate tub from the shower which gave us a nice, warm soak upon retiring in the evening. I have no issues with regards to cleanliness. I gave it a 10.

We were expecting check-in to be a breeze.  However, the front desk staff made up for it by upgrading our room.  Location is very good, very central in the Orchard Road area, close to the good shopping centers so that if you need to get anything with little time on hand, this is a good hotel to stay in.  Room was clean and a good size, compared to usual Singapore hotels, good space between two twin beds, and the bathroom allows you a lot of elbow room--separate shower stall from the bathtub and a wide counter to put all your toiletries in (a good thing when you have a roommate).
Food was very disappointing though--for the price of the breakfast buffet, we expected more than bacon,ham, and sausages in the continental section of the buffet.  While there are sections for Indian, Malay, Indonesian food, it would be good to include real hot dishes in the continental section of it.
Even the quality of food in the regional selections was not so good.

Yet lobby staff does not know how to direct customers therefore the area in front of the check-in counter is always chaotic. There seems to be no line for check-in and check-out and so there are always people who jump the queue.

Stayed 5 nights in May 2013,Solo traveler,"Reviewed June 08, 2013","I was there with my mother, who loves to shop -- and Mandarin Orchard Hotel is the perfect place to stay at for her because it's very close to shopping centers AND it has its own shopping center. More than that, it's located right in the middle of the Orchard Road strip so it's fairly convenient to walk toward either end of the strip (more shopping centers along the way). That way, we can shop, return to the hotel to put our bags and go out again within five minutes. So we need not carry our shopping bags all over. As for the room itself we really like it. The bathroom is great. Clean and luxurious. View is also great. Bed is comfortable. Fast internet connection, too. We also stay on the Club Lounge floor -- and for an additional price, we receive a package for breakfast + lounge use + 2 pcs laundry per day. Lounge use: tea time + cocktail hour. Lots of cakes and snacks and what not. The lounge offers a great view of Singapore. So you really won't starve if you were to stay in the hotel all day. The staff are also friendly.

Stayed 3 nights in May 2013,Business traveler,"Reviewed May 20, 2013","I usually stay at another hotel on my many visits to Singapore but gave Mandarin Orchard a go as my wife wants to be near the shops, aka Orchard. It is a working holiday for me and I work in the hotel. Somerset train station is also next door so that is convenient. 
Generally everything was great especially I made housekeeping clean the room in the afternoons as I work in the room and they are prompt. Few exceptions:
1) More of a Singaporean issue, no free internet, I ask and was given complimentary internet (this goes for most hotels in Singapore, just ask!). But on Monday 13th, the IT folks at the hotel mess up the internet and I had to go to my local Singapore office to work. Hey guys, I am in IT when you do things like this, test this. 
2) Not enough TV channels, I am a F1 and American Idol fan (ok a little sad, I know) and both are not available in Mandarin Orchard, Spanish Grand Prix and Idol final on that week I am in the hotel. Urgghhh! 
3) I settled my bill a day earlier because I had to leave for the airport like 7 AM the next day. After fixing my bill reception cancel my current room pass and issue new ones, causing my wife's card not to work and had to go to reception to get access. Why does the hotel need to do this? I had done early checkouts at tens of hotels and this is the first time this happens.
4) I start my day very early, 6 AM and I get out of the room so my wife don't have to hear me yell into my phone. The lobby is NOT a great place to sit. It looks like a carpeted tennis court, more sitting area would be nice. The bar isn't open so I happily sat there and do not need to order a scotch at this hour. 
5) The gym is terrible! When you get to the floor (36 on main tower), it looks like the floor belongs to a backpackers joint and you had to take a flight of steps to get there (ok, why am I complaining about a flight of steps when I am going to the gym?)

I stayed once before at Mandarin Oriental Hotel before. My room was 1042. (Period of staying -  It was alright, until this year I happened to experience:

1. A very stressful, unprofessional, uncoordinated check-in staff. They were not as friendly as they used to be. The Asian female staff behind the counter was quite stressful because she handled me without smile. She moved me to a male staff, Indian guy who said I need to have my online paper printed out to check in. 
So, since I didn't have it print, I was trying to find it with my iPhone. I couldn't find it and thankfully, the male staff beside the Indian guy, named Tsubasa (some name similar with this), told me I only need my passport and he handled me very friendly. HOWEVER, I booked for twin bed and I only got King size. He even told me “If I can give you suggestion, next time Miss, you should book an earlier flight to get what you want –twin bed” – WHAT IS GOING ON!??!! I PAID I BOOKED AND THE BLAME WAS ON MY FLIGHT? IT WAS MY RIGHTS TO BOOK ANY FLIGHT AND MY RIGHT TO GET WHAT I WANT FOR WHAT I PAID!! –SERIOUSLY I WAS REALLY ANGRY AT THAT TIME! MANDARIN HOTEL IS NOT PROFESSIONAL ANYMORE, for a customer who HAVE PAID for what she wanted, and SHE DIDN’T GET WHAT SHE WANTED. THAT’S RIDICULOUS!! EVEN I GOT THE BLAME FOR FLIGHT. WHAT IS THAT!! 

2. BATHROOM SMELL OF CIGGARETTES  – So, after check-in counter put me in the NON SMOKING FLOOR. During mid night, I woke up and went to restroom. I actually smelled as if someone’s smoking in the toilet. I checked the exhaust fan and realize that when I put tissue under the fan, the wind was coming in, NOT EXHAUSTING OUT OF THE ROOM.

Arrived around 4pm to check-in but was told our room is NOT READY. Believe  me we can only get our room at 5.30pm.

We had breakfast everyday at the Melt the World Cafe and the buffet is well stocked with American/Indian/Chinese foods so there are many options to satisfy many tastes. The fitness centre is well stocked and there is also an outdoor yoga studio which provides a very relaxing environment to do some stretching in. The service at the hotel was great, when we needed some suits dry cleaned within 24 hours it was taken care of and dropped off same day. The television in the room is large flat screen but the channel availability is limited, we were getting tired of watching Starhub (the only channel with western shows) since they seem to have an obsession with repeating Glee and American Idol, although there is a good selection of news channels and some international channels for those interested (Russian, Arabic, Indian, Chinese etc.) There is also a DVD player in the room and the hotel has a collection of DVD's that you can borrow to watch some movies in the evening.

Rooms: Ample, great ambience, big flat screen, good sound system, docking station connected to the TV audio, very nice desk, multiple plug convertors, nice design. And then there is the bed which was so comfortable (rarely so) that it was fit to ask the hotel what brand was it for future reference. Pillows were also first class. The toilette was large, marble, well appointed, with all you may need.

Facilities: The Pool on Level 5 is a must. It has a superb view of the Singapore skyline and it is large with ample beach chairs, and a restaurant and a bar attached to it. It is a must whether on business or leisure.

Internet: It was complimentary on the corporate rate. Great speed, throughout the property.

Lobby: It is very nice, and there are many bars, all of them perfect for relaxation and entertainment. Classy.

Location: You are right next (literally) to the Marina Square Mall, and 10 minutes walk to Marine Bay Sands Mall and the Riverside. Truly, the location can't be any better for business, and it is superb also for leisure (if you are smart enough to avoid Orchard Rd).

From the moment our cab stopped by the hotel entrance, we were greeted by a helpful staff who collected our things from the trunk. as we entered the lobby, a cheerful lady ushered us towards the reception area. During check-in, the receptionist was kind enough to inform us that discounted rates for breakfast can be purchased from the check-in counter - the hotel voucher we bought from Agoda does not include breakfast. Few minutes after we entered the room, someone knocked into our door and asked if we found everything in the room to be of comfort and as per our expectation (They don't do this in most hotels we've stayed in before). On the next day at breakfast, the lady who brought us a straw for my baby to use was very gracious in going out of her way by cutting the straw so it fits the shorter glass - this is to prevent my son from having difficulty using it. Every staff we meet along the corridors will always greet us with a smile. Even during check-out, we never even have to wait for so long!

Stayed 1 night in December 2012,Couple,"Reviewed January 07, 2013","When we first arrived, we got a bit confused as to where the lobby was. After locating it on the fifth floor, staff were around to guide patrons to the respective queues and usher us to an empty counter whenever available. However, since it's the Dec peak season, I found it a tad too busy and messy for my liking. But the service offered at the reception was efficient and helpful.

The room was large, and clean. Unfortunately, we were located in the Main Tower, which means there wasn't a view of Orchard Road and its Chrstmas lightings. Curtains were dark enough to block out the morning sun (plus point!). Bed was very comfortable, with the longish pillows that I love as you can just sink your head and shoulders into it. Had a great night's rest as we requested for late check-out at 12noon (original check-out was 11am).

The furnishings were a bit dated for my liking, especially the wardrobe and the TV console and the study desk area. Also felt that the sofa fabric could use a wash soon - stains and looked discoloured. The TV was a bit small, and it was in a strange position. Most hotels would have the TV right in front of the bed, but in this room, the wardrobe was in front of the bed, and the TV was located to the left, in a corner between the wardrobe and the study desk.

The toilet was big but only had a bathtub, with sliding doors which is great as it prevented any water from splashing or overflowing out onto the floor. The flush needs some improvement, doesn't work that well, you have to press quite hard and hold it there, and in the meantime, some water would leak out from the button in the wall. There were two sinks in the toilet, but one sink's drainage was not working well, kind of defeats the purpose of having two sinks?",“Fantastic Location in the Heart of Orchard””,Leong from Singapore

From prior stays, our last one was definetely the worst experience. We were asked to wait for hours to get our rooms. We came to the hotel at 4 PM (after the hotel normal check-in time). At that time the receptionist asked us to wait for 30-45 mins since the room hasn't ready. Considering we were having doctor's appointment at mt elizabeth hospital, so we were agreed to came back after. To make it even worse, after we came back around 5 PM, the rooms were not ready. The receptionists kept going inside to look for their so called ready-to-sell rooms. This experience had happened before to myself also to my other family on their previous stay. But this time is the worst one since we were travelling with our 80-years old grandparents who were tired after the whole hospital-related thingy. And the receptionists made us wait for hours. We finally manage to get our rooms by 6.30 PM. When we go up to our room, the door was already open since there was a housekeeping cleaning the toilet. To top it off, our luggages were not sent to our rooms until 9 PM. Don't know why it took that long to deliver our luggages. Overall, this was my worst experience staying in the hotel.

I'd reccommond club rooms for those who are looking for cosy and quiet getaway or on business trips. The the club lounge has a quiet ambience with comfortable chairs and the service crew was very attentive. It offers complimentry refreshments like coffee, tea and cookies all day long, breakfast in the morning, tea service in the afternoon, cocktails in the evening which was as good as a dinner spread. 
Only downfall was at our arrival, we were in the queue for about 10mins, a staff came to get us to go over to one of the reception counters,  we were just about to move when someone cut the queue and went ahead of us to the reception. The staff saw that yet he did not bother to say a single word to us but he turned and walked away. All I needed was a 'sorry' from a 5star hotel staff, I didn't mind the long wait. 
Everything else was fine apart from that. The room wss spacious, the bed was big and nice, the pillows were the best, it was really soft and very comfortable to sleep on. There was a massage chair in the room as well. ","Cosy bed, impeccable service and good food”",Zun from Myanmar

Stayed 2 nights in May 2012,Solo traveler,"Reviewed May 27, 2012","i stayed at the hotel for three nights in may 2012 and then came back a week later for a two-night stay.  the hotel is overly expensive, like most hotels are in singapore.  but, it offered all of the amenities expected of a five-star hotel:  marble bathroom with tub and separate shower, robes and slippers, in-room cofafee and tea, ironing board and iron, comfortable bed and an abundance of pillows, etc.  i did not sign up for internet because of the high cost.  it seems that most luxury hotels charge steep prices for internet service, while most budget accommodations offer it for free.  this comes across as simply a scheme to make more money for a service that is not that expensive for the hotels.  

when i arrived for the second visit, i was given an upgrade to the club level (but without the ""for-fee"" services of free breakfast and internet.  at check-in, i asked for a room in the newly remodeled orchard wing and the desk clerk spent quite a bit of time searching for rooms in that wing (he explained that they had reserved a room for me in the other wing).  he finally found a club level room and offered it at no additional charge.  he was quite helpful and accommodating.

on my first stay, i arrived at midnight, jet lagged from a 23-hour trip.  as soon as i stepped into the hotel, the bellman took my luggage and assured me that it would be put in my room, but he gave me no receipt and did not even ask my name.  nearly an hour later (at 1:00 am), still no luggage.  i went down to the fifth floor lobby and complained.  suddenly the bellman came around the corner with my bag.  i took it to the room myself.  but, overall the service was quite good.

i had read many reviews about the lobby being on the 5th floor (not really an issue at all) and the fact that there was no place for visitors to sit in the lobby.  the arrangement is a bit odd and could easily be fixed with a few sofas and chairs, but the designer would, no doubt, think it would clutter the design.",Luxury hotel in a very convenient location.”,Charles from United States

Stayed 1 night in April 2012,Couple,"Reviewed April 25, 2012","Being a 5-star rated hotel, checking-in should be a breeze. Reached the hotel close to 1pm. There were more than 6 counters and since there were no queue directions/sign, one will think the right way is to form a queue for each counter - so that's what happened. All guests were queuing into a row at each counter until we were told by the guest officer that there's only ONE queuing row for all 6 counters. Imagine having to wait 10 mins on the ""non-existent"" row and then have to leave and queue all over again with the rest of the guests? Another 10mins of waiting!

Upon my turn, was told that my room will only be ready in exactly an hour, seems fair enough since I've reached earlier than the usual check-in time. Left the counter at 1.12pm (i remember this because i personally checked the time with the receptionist before leaving) and came back 1.5 hours. Guess what? My room was still not ready! When i told her it's been 1.5 hrs, the receptionist still has the cheek to tell me that ive ""checked-in"" late at 1.41pm and came back to early for the room. You must be kidding me! Surprising enough, once i told her that, i got a room in minutes. I've never been pissed while checking in!

Here's another reason why you should stay away from this hotel. The furnishing of the room is stuck in the late 80s. Light fixtures were run-down, the bathroom was gloomy and the door to the toilet is epic. 80's wooden sliding door for goodness sake!

Breakfast was bustling (especially in the 9am-10am range)but I would prefer this high turnover of food and seating rather than having the fare sit disconsolately on plates for hours before being put to plate.

The overall room cleanliness are acceptable, as expected of a 4-star hotel.
The only downside of the hotel is the miserable queueing system when checking in or checking out. Considering the number of rooms available that is over 1000 rooms, only a handful of counters are available. To make it even worse, there is no queueing line established at all, so all the guests have to lookout for the counter with the shortest queueing line all by themselves, which I think is unacceptable for a hotel with 4-star rating.

Check-in took quite some time: all in all it took about 30 minutes before I could go to my room.
Internet connection was to be paid (30+ SGD for 24 hours), which should be free in a hotel of this class.
Room service was excellent. Although the food was not the warmest, the taste was excellent.
Mini-bar prices are quite high.
The cleaning of the room only took place around 4h30 pm, despite the fact I left the room 9h30 in the morning, and the sign ""please clean my room"" was on.
Quite a choice of (expensive) restaurants, if you're on a budget, there are very good alternatives nearby.

Stayed 3 nights in March 2010,Business traveler,"Reviewed March 09, 2010","It was confusing that this hotel kept changing names from Mandarin Orchard to Mandarin Meritus and then back to Mandarin Orchard.  Considering that there is still another Mandarin Oriental near the bay, you have to clearly specify to the tax driver which Mandarin you are heading to.

The hotel reception was also confusing.  Located on the 5th floor, it somehow diminishes the appeal of this hotel.  Going back to the room, there are available elevators that go directly to to the rooms from the orchard road entrance.  However, with so many elevators, it was confusing which one to take especially from the 5th floor.
It takes a loooooong time before the bell service can bring up or down your bag.  It is best to carry it yourself to avoid the unnecessary delays.

Firstly, the lobby on the fifth floor is very nice; the room where I stayed was very clean. However, in my opinion, I think your hotel need to change some matter as follow:
-	The room interior is not attractive.
-	The lobby in the first floor should add some more chairs because normally it takes time to call taxi in your country.
-	The temperature in the room is so cold (it should be 20degree to 22 degree) and you know, all of my staff were soar throat when they came back to Vietnam.
-	The distance from the main lobby to business center is very long; I met some difficulty when I wanted to fax my documents.

The buffet breakfast is located in the ballroom and the spread is more than adequate but after the 4th morning we realised that odd days were menu A and even days menu B which differed very little from each other.
The Observation Deck on the 38th floor is a great place to hangout for happy hour drinks and the Chatterbox Restaurant which is a floor above that is also a must. Both offer panoramic views of the city. Unfortunately the windows could do with a good clean.

This hotel, although popular obviously also through its position has managed to stayed in tune with the expectations of a modern day traveller. The rooms are well designed and with good enough bathrooms offering bath and shower.

"Reviewed November 08, 2007",Business traveler,"Reviewed November 08, 2007","My wife and I moved to this hotel from Swissotel Stamford whilst on a business trip. The Swissotel definitely was not up to the star rating and the Meritus Mandarin was! There were staff everywhere asking whether you needed any assistance and it was always done in a friendly manner. The hotel is in Orchard road with plenty of good shopping and access to local eateries. However, we did eat in the Pine Court restaurant on the 35th floor of the hotel and it was exceptional Asian/fusion food.

The cost of the hotel was to the order of USD$300 per night so you would expect it to be good but many other hotels these days charge you for a fancy marble foyer and stiff-necked highly-trained staff trained to be indignant at your requests!",You get what you pay for!”,Stephen from Australia
"Reviewed August 25, 2007",Couple,"Reviewed August 25, 2007","Seriously, I really despise being charged for the internet usage whereas other hotels in other countries are giving their customers free internet. This ought to be changed asap to avoid further tarnishing Singapore's already 'too-expensive-not-worth-going' reputation. Why are people avoiding Singapore and travel to places like Thailand or Malaysia? Enough said!

Stayed 3 nights in August 2018,Family with young children,"Reviewed August 12, 2018","Booked the hotel for two friends. Surprisingly disappointed as they had very good experiences staying in Mandarin in other countries. These are their feedback:

1. Not much variety for breakfast; not to mention everyone has to queue (there might be a valid reason but the experience is bad compared to ones in other hotels)
2. Room is very poorly soundproofed
3. Had problem with the toilet door; they staff who came to fix it was impatient and slammed the door closed
4. One staff who is Chinese race insists she spoke in English (she could; but, when does customer must adapt to the hotel's individual staff's preference?)
5. Ordered food to the hotel room twice; doesn't taste to the standard of as a star hotel (big portion though).

Hotel comparison: I stayed in Hiliton, Marriot and other five star hotels in chicago and New york. This hotel does not even come close to Hilton or Marriot or even Holiday Inn. 

Location: Good for luxury shopping but limited collection. The shops like Louis vuitton, MK, Prada and others have limited collection and expensive compare to prices in new york and chicago. 

This place/hotel is would be ideal for the people whose countries close to singapore and wants to shop luxury brand..

People who is visiting singpore for tourism stay close to suntech/bugis/chinatown/little india. You can experience local food and easier to commute.

After waiting for more than 30 mins with a baby, the passenger behind told us that hotel customer just need to wait at the hotel doorstep and the line that we were in were for general public hence why almost all the taxi stopped at the doorstep rather than the side that we were lining at. There were no sign and the concierge told us to wait at the general public line, but they let other hotel customers get on the taxi at doorstep.

I thought I was being nitpicky and waived it off. The next day, we came back around 8PM and found out that surely the shower had not been cleaned because there was still hair from the day before. Cookie crumbs from the side table had not been cleaned either. I called to complain, but it was too late for me to accept any cleaning crew as my kids were already going to bed.

My mother was visiting Singapore and I decided to treat her to an overnight Staycation at Orchard for Mother's day to relax. 
Ended up a bit stressed instead. 
- Check-in took a while
- got offered a room upgrade with a small fee. Not too bad. 
- asked to have the bags brought up, but it took a while for them to bring it up. We had to call to follow-up on this. 
- room temperature was a bit strange. It was either too warm or too cold.
- asked for some extra bottled water and made an inquiry to the front desk, took them a while to come back to us. Again, we had to call to follow-up on it for them to come back to us.  
- Shower and sinks didn't have adequately hot water during the first day, but it was still warm. However, it was freezing cold the next day. Couldn't shower and had to wait for engineering to fix it. They did manage to fix it. But we ended up not having much time for a leisurely breakfast as we had originally planned. A lot of the breakfast food was cold, despite the buffet only closing an hour after we came in.

The check-in process was arduous.  We arrived at mid-night, the staff was not very friendly, struggled with communication, and was not familiar with the rooms.  Although I had paid for a larger room which I assumed would accommodate my 2 small children, I was advised that it was the same size as the smaller rooms (even though the internet advises that it is larger) and was then told that the charge for an extra bed for my 10 year old child was SGD 100!!!!!  (50% the cost of the room!!) This is absolutely insane!!!!  I could have stayed across the street at the Marriott for far less than the combined price and not have been charged for an extra bed.  At midnight after a long journey, this is definitely NOT the type of information that you want to hear. Especially since no manager was on duty and there are no other options at this time of night.  Very poor from the hotel. 

Breakfast quality is mediocre, space is loud and crazy busy and really geared toward mass tourism. It isn't bad...its just not fabulous and if I were traveling alone on business would opt for breakfast elsewhere given the cost.

The special offered on the website included b'fast, internet and tour bus tickets.  While we normally would never have used this, since we purchased it, we had planned our day around using the bus tickets.  Be advised, that that tickets the hotel offers are the cheapest ones available ($14 ticket) and the hop-on-hop-off route doesn't take you to any of the sights that most tourists want to see ($33 ticket).

This time I was luck as I got the room on an offer, shame that they gave me a room that was communicating with another (there is a door that separates the two rooms) and basically I could not close my eyes the first night because my neighbor was snoring like a tractor in first gear!
They promptly changed my room, and got a standard one with no common door or anything. 
Apart from this incident the rooms in the Tower section are quite old, and to be honest noise insulation could be better (a lot of noise comes from the traffic underneath in Orchard Road), but they are spacey, well equipped with many amenities, tv's and everything you would expect from an hotel like this.

Stayed 3 nights in January 2015,Family with teens,"Reviewed January 25, 2015","I have stayed at the Mandarin Orchard a number of times but this is the first time I booked it using Agoda. I think there is an unwritten preference given to guests depending where the booking was made. I was initially given 2 rooms which were in such bad condition that you could smell the mustiness of the air when you walk through the door. The carpets were also old and stained. The air conditioning was not working well too. 

My rooms were changed after I complained. I thank the manager for doing this. My other shock came when I wanted to validate my parking ticket. I was told that my booking did not allow me this facility and it was because I booked with Agoda. This was never mentioned in the booking summary emailed to me from Agoda. I had never had a car parking validation issue with all my previous bookings.

My rating for the hotel is based on the possibilty that you could get rooms that are not befitting a 5* hotel. In addition, the facilities which one would take as a given, is hidden so deep down in the fine prints that it is not possible to know till you want to use it. Not sure whether this is the hotel's or Agoda's problem. In any case,I would think twice about staying here until the remaining rooms are renovated.

Also when I checked in I was told that only twin rooms were available. When I said that I booked a double room I was informed that the booking didn't specify the type of room. While technically this may have been correct, I had assumed that the booking was for a double room unless otherwise stated, so I find it a bit ridiculous that the hotel would assume that I wanted a twin room. We were finally offered a double room but I am pretty sure it was of a lower standard than what I booked. On top of that there were a few other minor issues during the stay which by themselves may not have been a problem, but on top of the slow check in and problem with the room type added to my disappointment in the hotel.

Throughout the first two weeks of our stay, we had to tolerate the sound of drilling from an above floor.

There were further problems with noise due to other guests on our floor shouting at their children and smoking (which then gets into the air conditioning system), yet this is not the hotel's fault.  The soundproofing in the building is not wonderful, however, as we could often hear our neighbours' television well into the night.

except this, the others are fine because the location is really perfect and convenient. Hope they can improve this.

Recommendation: FIGHT  for your rights next time you have the same situation like me. 
They will always find a room for you after you insist your request. Because this is only a basic requirement a hotel should do!

To be fair, not the hotel's fault as the check-in time was stated during booking.  But still found it inconvenient and irritating. My pet peeve during the stay was the slow reaction time for the room housekeeping service.  I requested for privacy most of the time, but called the reception or switched on the clear the room indicator before I left the hotel every day.  I am used to other major hotels in the region.  Their service is always prompt and the room is always ready when I return to the hotel even one hour later. For this hotel, I returned 2 hours later and the room still wasn't cleaned.   On one occasion, the indicator switch was even off! And I had informed the operator to come ""now"".
They did slip a note under the door on each occasion they arrive later, but I am just too tired to bother calling them again.  Who knows how long they would take to arrive again?  In my stay there, I think my room was cleaned only once.  And even then, they forgot to replenish my bath towels. Overall, the room was rather old but I didn't mind.  But some items need replacing badly.  The bathroom shower glass door couldn't close completely and I had to hold the door most of the time during the shower to stop water from splashing the floor outside.  Frankly, its laughable.

I found it inconvenient having to kneel down every time I wanted to on/off the switch.  Shifted the adaptor to a socket on the wall near the table.  Only then I found out he reason why.  The socket wasn't working!  The only working socket was taken up by my Mac's adaptor. Hence I was working without the table lamp most of the time. For the price, I would hesitate to stay here again.

This time around we found that the method of servicing of the rooms needs to addressed. Every day the one service did not finish the job - there were always towels missing and this of course required a second visit to the room by the staff. Inefficient use of staff time - hence one of the reasons for complaints about room servicing as noted by other clientele comments.  This hotel has two different towers of rooms. You must take note of which tower your room is in and also which set of elevators you are to use. It can be confusing for some when in a hurry to get to room or go out via either the shopping centre or the front entrance lobby. If you have breakfast included in your booking, the buffet caters to most tastes adequately but it is not a ""flash"" breakfast. Breakfast costs $45 Singapore dollars per person if you do not have it included in your booking. They do serve ""real"" bacon though! Also, when arriving at the hotel you must go to the 5th floor in order to check in.

For even the slightest discount would certainly attract ones attention to return but as the discommfort was at my expense, well this is where it may hurt M.O.H stating such as any person reading this may reconsider there plans which then becomes a total loss to M.O.H therefore should a discount have been a better option???

I have to say - I really didn't enjoy my stay there- I basically needed a room to hide out in and at this time the tv system was down for the entire time so I couldn't even watch the news- I asked how long until it was fixed but it was out the entire time I was there (2 days) . On my last day, I got a note apologising but I felt that if they were truly apologetic they could have offered either a discount room or meals or even just a free movie ticket to those affected. It was very poor for a hotel which claims to be 5 star. Also I ate in  both nights, which was not very good and on the 2nd night I got food poisoning from the chicken salad. I didn't eat anywhere but the hotel. And my third complaint is on checkout I was waiting inline and the checkout girl approached me and asked how she could help ( which was nice) and I told her I was just checking out, to which she told me to wait. However another gentlemen behind me was asked the same thing, provided with a wide smile and told to go before me. I was not impressed.

It's also within a 5 minute walk to either the Orchard or Somerset MRT stations which makes it extremely convenient for tourist or business travelers.

However, despite the fairly new refurbishment done, the rooms are not well kept & looks a tad dull & dated. The location of the lobby and entrance to the hotel is not ideal & doesn't make one feel welcomed and in fact is confusing as you have to literally look for the lobby on level 5.

One thing to note is that only buffet breakfast is offered which is not ideal if one prefers a smaller a la carte or continental breakfast which is not offered.

The usual statement is 'Subject To Availability"" however with modern computers and networking was it That Hard for the Hotel to have the room ready on that day as per my instructions without keeping us another 45mins???
The ugly side to all of this is how they register you, take the credit card details, passport no's they wait till last moment to tell you Your Room Is Not Available please be seated. 
If a booking is made then the hotel should block the room on said date as they know for sure the guests will be arriving. 
Also I specifically requested for Non Smoking but they wanted us put into Smoking section room.

Stayed 1 night in June 2009,Couple,"Reviewed June 19, 2009","Location was excellent for the price we paid and with Agoda points was able to get a reduction.  I would say its a holiday hotel and not really a business hotel.  Location is super if you are their for a holiday right next to Takashimaya with a stones throw to every thing.  

The lobby is very un impressive ! The staff behind the counters even though they look good in their chinese style dresses but ZERO smiles and almost mechanical ! I had better reception in hotels in Shanghai and Beijing.

The Room is not bad decent size with all the required facilities.  Decent size bathroom ... though a little cleanliness could have helped as it showed signs of over use.

View is nothing to write home about especially with the hotel in front being refurbished.

I am sure once the shopping center opens things will change.   Also the cineplex right behind was a great advantage if you enjoy the movies.

Highlight was going to the lounge on the 38th floor which has an amazing view of night time Singapore. We were their with a guest and it was really relaxing and amazing service with lots of smiles.  It was if we were at a different hotel.

Over all not a bad stay !  Did not have Brekky so cannot comment on the dining facilities.

Stayed 3 nights in April 2009,Business traveler,"Reviewed April 27, 2009","I had mixed experience at Meritus Mandarin. My secretary has booked this hotel for me online and this my first experience at Meritus Mandarin in Singapore though I'm a frequent traveler. First of all when I walked into the hotel my sincere first impression was where did my secretary has booked me in. I was taken to an basement entrance by my taxi driver whom I got from the airport. When I walked into the hotel I realised that it's a five star hotel and some construction work is carried out on the actual entrance of the hotel. 
I was on a business visit and I had another colleague from the same company and we occupied two rooms. When I walked into the room, the room was well cleaned and all required facilities and equipment were available. I had a king size bed which I prefer always with a LCD TV having about 40 odd channels. The 38th and 39th floors are the hotel pub/bar and the restaurant respectively. This is an observation gallery where you can have a Panoramic view of Singapore. The bar was nice and had a variety and the stewards were good. I used the restaurant only for breakfast and the food and the service was good. 

H'ever, I had some bad experience too. My Colleague's room key did not work sometimes and the guest had to go to the reception to get the room key activated several times. The second bad experience the worst was that we informed the reception at 1400 hrs on 24th that we are checkin out and wanted a bell boy to carry our luggage. We waited for 25 minutes and have informed the duty Manager as well. When we remind the answer from the reception and the duty Manager was that the bell boy is on his way to our room. H'ever, at 1430 we, from rooms 2309 and 2310 took our luggage by ourselves to the reception for checking out. When we complained this to the reception, the girl at the counter wanted us to lodge a complain and handed over a form. We had to catch a flight and did not have time to waste as we have already lost 30 mins. ",Days at Meritus Mandarin - Singapore”,CHANDIMA from Sri Lanka
Stayed 7 nights in April 2009,Couple,"Reviewed April 17, 2009","Our stay in the Meritus Mandarin Hotel was an expensive experience.
We were greeted at the reception with the statement ""Breakfast not included"". The price stated was an additional S$35 per person, per day for buffet breakfast. We were actually charged S$84.75 for 2 persons per day. Most mornings we had to queue for up to 30 minutes to get seated and when we did there were just scraps of food remaining.
Although, our room had an internet access the charges were excessive at S$10 every 15 minutes.
We waited 90 minutes for our suitcase to be delivered to our room, which I thought was a poor service for a 5 star hotel.
The room was nicely furnished, but in a dirty condition when we arrived, however, the room maid did sort this out the following day.
The TV remote batteries were flat when on our arrival, the reception said they would send a technician to resolve the problem, after the 3rd day nothing had been done. The room maid eventually changed the batteries.
We assumed the mineral water that was placed in the room (not in the mini-bar) was complementary – it was charged as a mini-bar cost: S$8.55 for less than a liter of water.
During our stay, the hotel was undergoing major building work. These things happen, but the machinery noise was quite annoying as the work continued up to mid-night.
The hotel is in a very good location for shopping and restaurants. We soon discovered it was much cheaper to eat outside the hotel, the surrounding restaurants offered a much wider variety of international foods at a reasonable price and good quality.
We were surprised at the lack of security with the Meritus Mandarin Hotel, we have become accustomed to walking through security scanners and bags being checked at the entrance of most hotels around the world.
